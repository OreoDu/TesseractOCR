Many combinatorial optimization problems in practical applications have unique
nuances and constraints, which make it impossible for us to solve known problems
such as TSP only with the most advanced solutions. And this process requires us to
develop heuristic methods for specific problems and it may be lengthy and arduous.
And also it may require the domain experts to detect certain structures in the
combined search space of a particular problem, However, when algorithm design
can be automated through machine learning, the above problems can be solved.
And perhaps a better solution can be produced.
